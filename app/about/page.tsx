                  We’re excited to announce Prime to the world and showcase what happens when rivals come together as brothers and business partners. Our goal was to create a fantastic hydration drink that can fuel any lifestyle.
                  <br /> <br />
                  Over the past year, we’ve worked countless hours to formulate the product from scratch, lock in deals with the largest retailers in the world, and build a multi-hundred person team to get our products to the shelves.
                  <br /> <br />
                  We’re humbled by the process of creating a real brand & look forward to competing with some of the biggest beverage companies in the world. As underdogs, we always cherish the opportunity to show the world what’s possible.
                  <br /> <br />
                  Now that we’re both fighting for the same team, we truly believe the sky is the limit.
